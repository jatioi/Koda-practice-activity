#Create a program that asks the user to enter a day of the week (e.g., "Monday," "Tuesday").
# Use a case statement to determine if it's a weekday or weekend. If it's a weekday (Monday to Friday),
# print "It's a weekday." If it's a weekend (Saturday or Sunday), print "It's the weekend."


week = ("monday" "tuesday" "wednesday" "thursday" "friday")
